It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms.;not_sexism

Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved.;not_sexism

Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on.;not_sexism
