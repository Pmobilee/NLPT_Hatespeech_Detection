Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past.;not_sexism;;;;;
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.;not_sexism;;;;;
however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.;not_sexism;;;;;
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.;not_sexism;;;;;
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch).;not_sexism;;;;;
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.;not_sexism;;;;;
phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.;not_sexism;;;;;
in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect.;not_sexism;;;;;

@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.;not_sexism;;;;;
@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.;not_sexism;;;;;

@a_man_in_black WELL ACTUALLY I'm kiiiiiiiinda a rainbow haired expert.;not_sexism;;;;;
@a_man_in_black in all seriousness, i've been dying my hair since my teens. I can't remember the last time I used a single shade. Too flat.;not_sexism;;;;;
@ElisaRockDoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade SUPER quickly. the blues are amazing.;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian Depends on shade. When doing blues, most MP fades out greyish blue, most SFX fades out w/green tint.;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian I usually mix brands depending on how they fade. SFX has fantastic pinks, though. N'Rage does some decent pinks, too.;not_sexism;;;;;
@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair.;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian it's relatively new. most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx.;not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian (brb, am starting to feel feelings in my scalp, that means it's time to wash this stuff out.);not_sexism;;;;;
@milfgaardian not sure. i kind of like when it fades on short hair, if it's dyed well. it's less monotone.;not_sexism;;;;;

@milfgaardian pravana vivids are my favorite line for blues, easily. pastels line is gorgeous, but fades SO quick. days to weeks.;not_sexism;;;;;

This might be my favorite tweet by rogue, ever. https://t.co/HhSQGdlHgN  Because he assumes my twitter handle is my UNIX login.;not_sexism;;;;;
UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github.;not_sexism;;;;;
And then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws. https://t.co/ubnhhv9yQ0;not_sexism;;;;;
PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD.;not_sexism;;;;;
All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.;not_sexism;;;;;
In short, this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf;not_sexism;;;;;
btw, guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So, you know. COLLUSION.;not_sexism;;;;;
Oh, yeah. and FreeBSD is the OS that runs on your Playstations. Why so salty?;not_sexism;;;;;

@deathofrats01 yup. ^.^ unless it's your field, it's not surprising that you wouldn't know.;not_sexism;;;;;

Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious.;not_sexism;;;;;
BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking.;not_sexism;;;;;
So, just to save you all some time, BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev.;not_sexism;;;;;
I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them.;not_sexism;;;;;
The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade.;not_sexism;;;;;
"So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?""";not_sexism;;;;;
And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.;not_sexism;;;;;
It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.;not_sexism;;;;;
"But all of these attacks of ""not enough commits"" or ""had a dude do it for you"" or ""slept with people"" proves my point. Thanks for that.";not_sexism;;;;;

I like the way Blizzard is tackling toxic players in Heroes of the Storm. It's a good first step.;not_sexism;;;;;
Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved.;not_sexism;;;;;
For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this.;not_sexism;;;;;
Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on.;not_sexism;;;;;
Putting the tools into the hands of users is a GREAT idea. We need more active solutions for protecting ourselves.;not_sexism;;;;;
One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better.;not_sexism;;;;;

@athenahollow on one hand, the only voice she has is with gaters - which doesn't really affect OAPI's reach.;not_sexism;;;;;

KAT AND ANDRE CANT COOK #MKR;not_sexism;;;;;
I cannot STAND Kat and Andre. I don't even want to look at them right now. Kat is literally Satan in a red dress tonight. #MKR;sexism;;;;;
Faaark! The blonde promo girl walks with all the grace of a tradie in drag #mkr;sexism;;;;;
Kat is one of those rare pieces of trash that get even uglier when she smiles #MKR;sexism;;;;;

"""Strategic""scoring should be classed as cheating. Everyone scored Kat and Andre fairly and accordingly. Why can't they do the same? #mkr";not_sexism;;;;;
I blame the other teams for this. #mkr;not_sexism;;;;;
I honestly think Kat has mental health issues. #mkr;sexism;;;;;

But... I don't ever want to see or hear Kat again. Ever. #MKR;not_sexism;;;;;
And I still prefer Kat to freakshow Annie #mkr;sexism;;;;;
Can they just send Kat and Andre home anyway because they're rude and annoying and score everyone strategically  #MKR;not_sexism;;;;;
Sorry, but even if you did make it through there was no way you would have made it to the end. #MKR;not_sexism;;;;;

That's why we have @join_oapi. Because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right.;not_sexism;;;;;
Combating online harassment doesn't mean jerks won't exist. Everyone is a jerk, sometimes. But you shouldn't ever be afraid.;not_sexism;;;;;
Online harassment takes many forms. Some is actionable, by the service provider (ToS) or law enforcement.;not_sexism;;;;;
We seek to help clarify those policies and gain better enforcement, as well as provide users with the power to filter what they experience.;not_sexism;;;;;
